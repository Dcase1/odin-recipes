Recipe Project for TOP

This is the first html project for The Odin Project. In this project, I am to create
a webpage that houses links to various recipes. In doing so, i will have demonstrated
setting up the html boilerplate, adding headings and paragraphs, using ordered and unordered lists, including images, creating relative links, and the basics of utilizing git.
